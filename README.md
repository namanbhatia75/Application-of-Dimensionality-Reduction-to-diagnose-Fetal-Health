# Application-of-Dimensionality-Reduction-to-diagnose-Fetal-Health

Fetal mortality is an important public health issue that is sometimes neglected.” According to the “National Center for Health Statistics”, there are around 1 million fetal deaths in the United States each year. Even though the mortality has
been decreasing for years, the fetal death rate in the United States has saturated at a high number. 

Fetal health has a direct impact on maternal health as well. The introduction of use of “cardiotocograms” has made critical data collection easier yet correctly diagnosing conditions is tedious. A combination
of digital health and machine learning technologies are being used worldwide to detect and prevent a lot of diseases. 

Using our knowledge of various existing data science techniques and the data set provided to us that contained real life CTG exams along with their fetal health classifications by experts, we have developed an efficient algorithm to make automated assessment of fetal health conditions possible
